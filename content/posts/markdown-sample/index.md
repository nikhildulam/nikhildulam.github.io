# About Life and Death


Life asked Death, "Why do people love me and Hate you?" Death replied" Because you are a beautiful lie and I'm a painful truth"
The tragedy of life is not death but what we let die inside us while we live

Death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful and hence neither good nor bad.

It is not the years in your life but the life in your years that counts.Life may be happy, cool, great, weird, miserable, full of pain or overwhelming... But Whatever life may bring, thank God for giving us a Chance to live"
